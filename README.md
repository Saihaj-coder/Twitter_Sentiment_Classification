## Twitter Sentiment Classification
Our task is to develop a model that classifies Twitter tweets into three sentiment categories ---> positive, negative, and neutral. To achieve this, we explore and implement two distinct approaches. First, we use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is adept at capturing the sequential nature of text data through its memory cells, while applying regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Second, we leverage the power of DistilBERT by fine-tuning this transformer-based model, which benefits from pre-trained contextual embeddings to better understand and classify nuanced sentiments in the tweets. By comparing these methodologies, we aim to determine the most effective approach for accurate sentiment classification.
