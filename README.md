## Twitter Sentiment Classification
- Developed a sentiment analysis model to classify tweets into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Initial approach involved implementing a LSTM network, which effectively captures the sequential nature of text data through its memory cells. Next set of approaches involved fine-tuning transformer-based models such as BERT, DistilBERT to leverage pre-trained contextual embeddings for improved performance. By comparing the performance of these methodologies, the project aimed to identify the most effective strategy for accurate sentiment classification.
